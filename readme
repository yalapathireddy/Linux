I'll explain the LVM (Logical Volume Management) script and its components:

Script Purpose:

Creates a complete LVM setup interactively
Handles the entire process from physical volume to mounted filesystem
Key Functions:

check_root(): Ensures script runs with root privileges
validate_device(): Verifies the block device exists
Step-by-Step Process:


Physical Device → Physical Volume → Volume Group → Logical Volume → Filesystem
User Inputs:

Device path (e.g., /dev/sdb)
Volume Group name
Logical Volume name
Size (e.g., 10G)
Mount point
LVM Commands Used:

pvcreate: Creates Physical Volume
vgcreate: Creates Volume Group
lvcreate: Creates Logical Volume
mkfs.ext4: Formats with ext4 filesystem
mount: Mounts the volume
Safety Features:

Root privilege check
Device validation
Clear error messages
Persistence:

Adds entry to /etc/fstab for automatic mounting at boot
Output:

Shows progress during execution
Provides final summary of all operations
This script provides a user-friendly way to set up LVM storage while incorporating necessary safety checks and proper filesystem configuration.

chmod +x create_lvm.sh

To use this script:

Run it as root: sudo ./create_lvm.sh
Follow the prompts to enter:
Device path (e.g., /dev/sdb)
Volume group name
Logical volume name
Size (e.g., 10G)
Mount point
Example usage:


$ sudo ./create_lvm.sh
Enter device path: /dev/sdb
Enter volume group name: data_vg
Enter logical volume name: data_lv
Enter size: 10G
Enter mount point: /mnt/data

The script will:

Create the PV, VG, and LV
Format the volume with ext4
Mount it at the specified location
Add an entry to /etc/fstab for persistence
Display a summary of the operations
